# Learning RL by reproducing CURL

Start with [the seven-page PDF](learning-guide.pdf). The
[LaTeX source](learning-guide.tex) and Makefile are next to it.

This is the **pilot-completed** edition, with a 17:13 UTC evidence cutoff. It explains the cartpole task,
reinforcement learning, self-supervised image matching, our comparison, and
what source review found. The full reference/control comparison is running. The
published scores and invented teaching examples are identified explicitly.

The [research protocol](../../experiments/curl_replication_20261004/README.md)
contains the selected comparison, run order, settings, resolved access issue and
resumption instructions. The [machine-readable manifest](../../experiments/curl_replication_20261004/manifest.json)
records source revisions and the tested compatibility runtime. Read the
[running findings](FINDINGS.md) for native result pointers and limitations, and
the [implementation review](IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md) for the focused independent review.

Build on a machine with a normal LaTeX installation:

```sh
make -C docs/curl-replication-2026-10-04
```

Or use Tectonic with the already-populated cluster cache:

```sh
make -C docs/curl-replication-2026-10-04 tectonic \
  TECTONIC=/project/alex_phd/research-cache/tools/tectonic-0.17.0-musl/tectonic
```

The Tectonic target deliberately uses only cached dependencies. On a new machine,
use `tectonic learning-guide.tex` from this directory to allow ordinary package
retrieval. The document uses Beamer as a letter-sized portrait reading layout,
not as a slide deck, because the article class was unavailable in the cluster's
offline cache. It uses readable 12-point text.

## Updating after a run

Add the actual run identity and cutoff, a curve sourced from per-episode records,
individual-seed results, a plain-language interpretation and a competing
explanation. Update the first and last pages' status at the same time. A successful
pilot is not a reproduced learning result; a missing endpoint is not a zero score.
Keep published reference scores separate from our measurements.

## Verification of this edition

Compiled with Tectonic 0.17.0 using cached dependencies on October 4, 2026,
at approximately 17:16 UTC. All seven letter-sized pages were inspected in the
first edition; changed first/last pages were checked again. The build reports no overfull
boxes, and extracted text stays within every page boundary. The numerical
teaching example was independently recalculated. The manifest parses as JSON,
and its decision count times action repeat equals the stated environment budget.

PDF SHA256:
`1a11cfe56e84e65ee416eac8411118646928500b56c0cee7a3cc6318128398ec`.
The runtime checks include real simulator behavior, CPU checkpoint restoration,
and a completed GPU pilot. These do not establish a full learning result.
